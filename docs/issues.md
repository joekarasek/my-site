# Issues I'v found

1. [x] Navbar not responding to position on the page (should become transparent).

2. [x] Background image is not showing. Transparancy behavior is in the css tied to a class "landing" that is not being assigned to the body of the html upon load. Can hard code landing in, but I'm afraid that what ever is broken on assigning the class to body is failing to assign the proper class else where.
