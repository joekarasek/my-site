H?KE is a web application that provides basic information on hiking trails around the Portland area, including the current weather.

This project was put together as a three day capstone project to the Level 2 Javascript class at Epicodus, a vocational school for aspiring programmers. This app is built on the Ember.js framework and utilizes three APIs (trailsApi,Open Weather Maps API, and Google Maps API) to generate information for user.
