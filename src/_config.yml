description: I'm a junior developer with a background in project management and environmental science. After working as a crew leader and field botanist for several years, I decided to switch career paths and foster my passion for computer science. Currently a student at Epicodus, I have experience working with Javascript, PHP, and a number of frameworks including Silex (web-app micro-framework for PHP), Mocha and PHPUnit (testing frameworks for Javascript and PHP, respectively), and Jekyll (a blog-aware static site generator, which was used to build this site). In the next few months I hope to expand my skills to include knowledge of Drupal and Javascript frameworks including node.js, ember.js, and react.js.
